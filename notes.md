# Potential Solutions for Audio Recognition Issues

1. **Verify Microphone Permissions**
   - Ensure the app has explicit permission to access the microphone. On iOS/macOS, the app must request microphone access (`AVAudioSession` and `AVAudioRecorder` require Info.plist entries). If permission was denied, the app will not capture any audio.

2. **Check Audio Session Configuration**
   - Review how `AVAudioSession` is set up. Using `.playAndRecord` with proper options like `.defaultToSpeaker` may help. Confirm that the session is activated before starting the engine.

3. **Reduce Audio Engine Overload**
   - Logs show `IOWorkLoop: skipping cycle due to overload`. This suggests the audio engine may not keep up. Lower the sample rate or buffer size, or ensure other processes are not hogging CPU.

4. **Handle Network Failures Gracefully**
   - The logs contain many `The network connection was lost` errors when sending audio to the API. Implement retry logic or show an error to the user when the network drops.

5. **Validate Whisper API Requests**
   - Confirm that audio files are correctly written and included in the HTTP request. Inspect the request size and format; ensure the audio chunk duration is reasonable (e.g. ~10 seconds or less).

6. **Review Voice Activity Detection**
   - If VAD is too sensitive, the app might generate tiny audio chunks that contain only noise, leading to poor transcription. Tweak the silence threshold and minimum chunk length.

7. **Test with Different Devices**
   - Try the app on another device or with a different microphone to rule out hardware issues. Sometimes built-in mics may have low gain or noise-cancelling problems.

8. **Check for API Key and Rate Limits**
   - Ensure the OpenAI API key is correct and not hitting rate limits. Repeated network failures might be due to invalid key or quota issues.

9. **Logging and Debugging**
   - Add detailed logging around audio capture and VAD decisions (e.g. when a chunk starts/ends, its length). This will help confirm whether the issue is capture or network related.

10. **Update Dependencies and OS**
    - Make sure the app is built with the latest SDK and runs on a device with up-to-date OS. OS bugs or outdated frameworks might cause unexpected audio problems.
